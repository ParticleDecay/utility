# About

This is a super dumb utility container. I got fed up with downlodaing base images that didn't have low level utilities like this available for troubleshooting.

List of utilitie can be found in the dockerfile, but primarily include network troubleshooting tools ( dig, traceroute, ping, nc, nmap, etc ).
